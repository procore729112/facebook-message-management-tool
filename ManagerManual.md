# Facebook Message Management Tool - Technical Documentation

## 🎯 Usage Scenario

When managing customer interactions on Facebook, businesses often face the challenge of handling a high volume of messages efficiently. For example, a small marketing agency might receive numerous inquiries through Facebook as they run an online campaign. In such a scenario, it’s crucial to have a system that can automate responses to ensure timely communication and improve customer engagement.

## 🛠️ How MadHub Fits In

MadHub offers a powerful solution for message management through its **Facebook Auto-Reply** feature.
